<h2>Description</h2>

This lesson is an introduction to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the LAMMPS package. It will cover the following topics:
  - Molecular dynamics simulation fundamentals.
  - Creating a LAMMPS input file.
  - Using force-fields and creating independant LAMMPS topology (data) files.
  - Computing and averaging physical properties during simulation.
  - Other software related to LAMMPS input creation, data post-processing, and visualization.

For this lesson, we expect attendees to be familiar with HPC environments.
We will *not* be covering the differences between HPC and regular computing environments.
This lesson is aimed at anyone who:
  - has experience using `bash` (or any other shell).
  - has an interest in running simulations using LAMMPS.

> ## Prerequisites
> You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
> using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
> You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
> on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`).
